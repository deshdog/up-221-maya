## UP 221: GIS & Spatial Data Science
### Hi, I'm Maya.

I'm a first year MURP and plan to concentrate in transportation. I'm a Bay Area native now living in South Central LA. I have two cats, Bhumi and Sheba. I love anything having to do with food (growing it, cooking it, eating it)!

### About This Course:
The work from this course demonstrates:
- The value of data for planning purposes through discovery, exploration, and analysis
- Critical evaluation of data and create frameworks to prepare data for research
- Application of data science programming techniques to produce relevant visualizations that inform urban policy
- Visualization of data spatially to communicate the importance of place-based informatics
- Production of publication-ready scholarly materials in the form of tables, charts, and maps

### Project Ideas
I'm interested in better understanding transportation efficiency models and systems analysis. I hope to find some datasets that will allow me to do this.

### Course Objective
I feel that I have a good grasp on coding in Python and basic data science skills. I'd like to use this course as an opportunity to dive into the nitty-gritty details of urban and spatial data science (i.e. How is data science being used in the planning profession vs planning academia? What are the limitations of urban data science? How does data ethics apply here?).
