## UP 221: GIS & Spatial Data Science
### Hi, I'm Maya.

I'm a first year MURP and plan to concentrate in transportation. I'm a Bay Area native now living in South Central LA. I have two cats, Bhumi and Sheba. I love anything having to do with food (growing it, cooking it, eating it)!

### The work from this course demonstrates:
- The value of data for planning purposes through discovery, exploration, and analysis
- Critical evaluation of data and create frameworks to prepare data for research
- Application of data science programming techniques to produce relevant visualizations that inform urban policy
- Visualization of data spatially to communicate the importance of place-based informatics
- Production of publication-ready scholarly materials in the form of tables, charts, and maps
